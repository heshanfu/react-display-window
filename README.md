# React Display Window

React Display Window is a simple tool to write documentation for when having a full guide is overkill. React Display Window is therefore best suited for one component libraries or libraries where all of the components are related.

It's also very useful during the development stage of these components libraries because it allows you to see the code working and running like in a real usage environment.
